  <h3>Have you been looking for the perfect recipe?</h3>
  <p>Whenever I look up a new recipe I always have to scroll past what seems about three full chapters of a person's life. At the very bottom is the recipe. What's worse is that some of the websites do not have a "Jump to the Recipe" button! The audacity!</p>
  <p>I wonder if people who post recipes build their own websites. I can only imagine what goes on in a website builder. I look forward to learning how to code and make this website more beautiful in the near future.</p>
  <p>Dont't worry. That is all of the intro I will include.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>flour</li>
    <li>patience</li>
    <li>self restraint to not eat the raw dough</li>
    <li>even more restraint to not eat every cookie that comes out of the oven</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather your ingredients and print off the recipe.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to the quantities and order of recipe!</li>
    <li>Double check before adding the ingredient to your bowl.</li>
    <li>Take your time.</li>
  </ol>
