  <p>Who would have thought that all you needed to make almond milk was almonds, water, and time.<p> 
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of raw almonds <em>(soaked overnight)</em></li>
      <li>5 cups of filtered water</li>
      <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
      <li>2 whole dates</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional for vanilla almond milk)</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add your soaked almonds, water, salt, and optional add-ins to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Keep it running for at least 1-2 minutes so you get the most out of your almonds.</li>
      <li>Strain using a nut milk bag.
      <li>Transfer milk to a jar or covered bottle and refrigerate. Will keep for up to 4-5 days, though best when fresh. Shake well before drinking, as it tends to separate.</li>
    </ol>
